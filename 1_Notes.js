//  A class is a blueprint for creating objects with predefined properties and methods.
//  Before classes, JavaScript used constructor functions and prototypes to achieve similar functionality.
// In constructor every time we create a new object, a new copy of the method is created in memory. To avoid this, we can define the method inside a class.

// Array functions

// concat : merges two or more arrays and returns a new array.
// every : tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.
// find : returns the value of the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function.
// filter : creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
// foreach : executes a provided function once for each array element. (does not return a new array)
// from : creates a new, shallow-copied Array instance from an array-like or iterable object.
// indexof : returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
// reduce : executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
// map : creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
// reverse : reverses the order of the elements of an array in place. The first array element becomes the last, and the last array element becomes the first

// React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive user experience. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. React uses a component-based architecture, enabling the creation of reusable UI components. 
    //  created by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
    
// dom - Document Object Model is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page. - runs in the browser

// virtual dom runs in the memory of the js engine (ram)
//  Virtual DOM - A lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses the virtual DOM to optimize updates to the real DOM by minimizing direct manipulations, which can be slow and inefficient. When the state of a component changes, React updates the virtual DOM first, then calculates the most efficient way to update the real DOM, leading to improved performance and a smoother user experience.





// query parameters -  are a way to pass data to a web page through the URL. They are typically used to filter or sort data, or to provide additional information about the request. Query parameters are added to the end of a URL after a question mark (?). Each parameter is represented as a key-value pair, with the key and value separated by an equals sign (=). Multiple parameters can be included in a URL by separating them with an ampersand (&).

// Example: 
// https://www.example.com/search?query=javascript&sort=asc&page=2
// In this example, the URL contains three query parameters: query, sort, and page. The values of these parameters can be accessed by the web page to customize the content that is displayed to the user.

// Practice Question: 
    // Build a mini student portal using react router
    // create a student portal application with the following requirements. 
    // You must use Routes, Dynamic Params, Navigation, State, Links, and 404 route.
